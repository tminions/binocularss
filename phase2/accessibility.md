## Marketed Audience and Non-marketed Demographics


Write a paragraph about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category such as "students" or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. For example, a program that converts txt files to files that can be printed by a braille printer are less likely to be used by people who do not read braille.
